# Biological Sequence Embedding
This repo is for sharing the featurization methods developed at the Markey Cancer Center with Sally Ellingson.


Reference proteins (proteins encoded by human chromosomes) are sourced from [here](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640).

Reference ligands (all metabolites found in
the human body) are sourced from [here](http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads).

We consider ``complex" space to consist of all pairs from these data sets.
