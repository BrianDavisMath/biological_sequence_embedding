# Biological Sequence Embedding
This repo is for sharing the featurization methods developed at the Markey Cancer Center with Sally Ellingson.


Reference proteins are sourced from <https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640>[here], and are the proteins encoded
for by human chromosomes.and

Reference ligands are sourced from <http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads>[here]. They consist of all metabolites found in
the human body.

We consider ``complex" space to consist of all pairs from these data sets.
